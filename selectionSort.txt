Selection sort
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j

        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

    return arr


# Example usage with user input
if _name_ == "_main_":
    # Take input from the user to create the array
    num_elements = int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))
    array = []

    for _ in range(num_elements):
        element = int(input("Enter an element: "))
        array.append(element)

    # Test the selection sort algorithm
    sorted_array = selection_sort(array)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
Output:
Enter the number of elements: 6
Enter elements:
4
67
4

33
2
5
Array before Sorting: 4 67 4 33 2 5
Array after Sorting: 2 4 4 5 33 67

Selection Sort :
Pass1 :nitially 0th index in considered as a
minimum and then it is compared with the
other element and swapped with minimum
element
Pass2 :Then index 1 is considered as
minimum and then checked with other and
swapped with minimum
Sooo onnnn till sorted
We need n-1 passes to sort the array
